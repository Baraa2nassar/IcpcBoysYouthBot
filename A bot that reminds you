a bot plan sending sceduals - weekly reminders

another idea is to make a command with all current program going
it opens a notepad

Perfect version of it:
	You type the name of the event and the date then 
		it adds it to a notepad and sceduals a time for it
		everyweek it reminds you an hour before,

	There is a command to give you all the current events going by opening a file
	You can make a command to see how many days until Ramadan
--------------------------
Part one: takes the name of the program and adds it to a cmd == DONE 
	Part two: Takes emojies on the message if you want to sceduale it, click the clock, if not click X (EXTRA)

Part three: takes time and make a weekly reocuring message (the main bot - this first)
	Step 1: Make the bot send weekly Friday reminders (the main point of it)
	Step 2: After you get a reoccuing method, you then can make a way to input other commands from users
	Step 3: merge the method with the CMD
	Step 4: add emojies to messages (here after you learn on emjies you can add also add a command to like and dislike on feedback channel for MSA)
	
EXTRA:
	Step 5: maybe tell the user what time is it when he asks

#tasks convert the time for it to be in eastern time
#you will need an if for the day (will be 12 hours which is 43200 seconds) and an if for the hour (acyncio will be 30 min which is 1800 seconds)
#always make sure to put the seconds meaning the seconds so convert the time outside the code
